# IQ Mate (Qolsys IQ Panel Integration & Automation Tool)

IQ Mate is a tool to help serious home automation folks make the most of their Qolsys IQ Panel. Use it to create advanced automations that can't be done in Alarm.com, and to integrate your IQ Panel with devices outside of the Qolsys & Alarm.com ecosystem.
