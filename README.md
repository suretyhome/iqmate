# IQ Mate (Qolsys IQ Panel Integration & Automation Tool)

IQ Mate is a tool to help more serious home automation folks make the most of their Qolsys IQ Panel. Use it to integrate your IQ Panel with devices outside of the Qolsys & Alarm.com ecosystem.

Automations are programmed in [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/), a visual flow editor that makes it easy to program complex automations.
